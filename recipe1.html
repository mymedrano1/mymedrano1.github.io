            <h1>Pozole Recipe</h1>
            <h2>History of Pozole</h2>
                    <p>Pozole originated in pre-Columbian Mexico where it was a sacred dish made by the Aztecs and it often included human meat in religious or spiritual rituals. After Spanish colonization, pork became the standard type of meat and pozole started becoming a more common dish and not ritualistic.As the recipe spread, different regions developed their own versions, such as red (rojo), green (verde), and white (blanco) pozole, ingredients may also vary depending on local available sources. Today pozole is a popular dish in Mexican culture and is usually made during celebrations and family gatherings. </p>
