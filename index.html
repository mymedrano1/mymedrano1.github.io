                <h2>Day to Day Life</h2>
                <h3><u>Academic Life</u></h3>
                 <p style="text-indent: 20px;">Hi! I'm a 14 year old freshman that attends Lane Tech Highschool.Lane Tech Highschool
                is a school ranked #3 best highschoolin Illinois right below Northside College Prep and
                Walter Payton. Lane Tech is a highschool located in the very north of Chicago while my
                house is located in the very south of Chicago in the west lawn area. I take the train and bus
                to school, specifically the orange and brown line trains along with the 49 and 152 buses.
                This commute takes me around 1 hour 15  minutes to complete. Living in the south side, 
                I went to Edward N. Hurley Elementary and Middle school which is around 5 minutes from
                where I live.I graduated from Hurley and I spent 7 years there from years 2nd through
                8th. I went to another Elementary school which was named Philip D. Armour Elementary.
                I spent the years PreK-1st at that Elementary School. Armour Elementary is located in
                Bridgeport but wasn't far from where I was living at the time.
                </p>
                <h3><u>Personal Life</u></h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 20px;"> At home, I'm still the same 14 year old girl, but I do things differently here. At home, I
                live with my mom, dad, brother and my 2 cats named Bee and Diamond. I spend alot of my time
                with my cats,which include feeding, playing, or simply hanging out on the couch doing nothing. At
                home, I also find myself watching movies,playing games, and playing instruments which include bass guitar 
                and drums. I started playing guitar when I was around 10 years old and I then started playing drums at 12.
                My little brother soon followed and also started playing guitar when he was around 10 aswell and advanced
                very quickly. My inspiration for music grew at a young age where I was constantly surrounded in music 
                whether if it was my grandpa playing his violin or my mom constantly playing her music aloud.
                </p>
